						Gandhi was an Indian activist who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. 
						Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights 
						and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "high-souled", 
						"venerable")– applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa – is now used worldwide. In India, 
						he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa)and Gandhi ji, 
						and known as the Father of the Nation..

					Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, India, and trained in law at the 
					Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South 
					Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, 
					he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and 
					discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns 
					for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.

					Gandhi led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 
					1930, and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many 
					occasions, in both South Africa and India. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore 
					the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food, 
					and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and political protest.

						Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 
						1940s by a new Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India.
						Eventually, in August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned 
						into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, 
						Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the 
						Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the 
						affected areas, attempting to provide solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto 
						death to stop religious violence. The last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, 
						also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. 
						Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating. Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, 
						who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing three bullets into his chest. 
						Captured along with many of his co-conspirators and collaborators, Godse and his co-conspirator 
						Narayan Apte were tried, convicted and executed while many of their other accomplices were given 
						prison sentences.

					<h2 >Early Life and Education</h2>
					<p>
						Young Gandhi was a shy, unremarkable student who was so timid that he slept with the lights on 
						even as a teenager. In the ensuing years, the teenager rebelled by smoking, eating meat and 
						stealing change from household servants.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although Gandhi was interested in becoming a doctor, his father had hoped he would also become 
						a government minister, so his family steered him to enter the legal profession. In 1888, 18-year-old 
						Gandhi sailed for London, England, to study law. The young Indian struggled with the transition to
						Western culture.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon returning to India in 1891, Gandhi learned that his mother had died just weeks earlier. 
						He struggled to gain his footing as a lawyer. In his first courtroom case, 
						a nervous Gandhi blanked when the time came to cross-examine a witness. 
						He immediately fled the courtroom after reimbursing his client for his legal fees.

					<h2>Gandhi in South Africa</h2>
						<p>
							After struggling to find work as a lawyer in India, Gandhi obtained a one-year 
							contract to perform legal services in South Africa. In April 1893, he sailed for 
							Durban in the South African state of Natal.
						</p>
						<p>
							When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, he was quickly appalled by the discrimination and 
							racial segregation faced by Indian immigrants at the hands of white British and Boer 
							authorities. Upon his first appearance in a Durban courtroom, Gandhi was asked to remove 
							his turban. He refused and left the court instead. The Natal Advertiser mocked him in 
							print as &ldquo;an unwelcome visitor.&rdquo;
						</p>
						<p>
							A seminal moment in Gandhi&rsquo;s life occurred days later on June 7, 
							1893, during a train trip to Pretoria, South Africa, when a white man objected to 
							his presence in the first-class railway compartment, although he had a ticket. 
							Refusing to move to the back of the train, Gandhi was forcibly removed and thrown 
							off the train at a station in Pietermaritzburg. His act of civil disobedience awoke 
							in him a determination to devote himself to fighting the &ldquo;deep disease of 
							color prejudice.&rdquo; He vowed that night to &ldquo;try, if possible, to root 
							out the disease and suffer hardships in the process.&rdquo; From that night forward, 
							the small, unassuming man would grow into a giant force for civil rights. Gandhi formed 
							the Natal Indian Congress in 1894 to fight discrimination.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the end of his year-long contract, Gandhi prepared to return to India until he 
							learned, at his farewell party, of a bill before the Natal Legislative Assembly 
							that would deprive Indians of the right to vote. Fellow immigrants convinced Gandhi 
							to stay and lead the fight against the legislation. Although Gandhi could not prevent 
							the law&rsquo;s passage, he drew international attention to the injustice.
						</p>
						<p>
							After a brief trip to India in late 1896 and early 1897, Gandhi returned to 
							South Africa with his wife and children. Gandhi ran a thriving legal practice, 
							and at the outbreak of the Boer War, he raised an all-Indian ambulance corps of 1,100 
							volunteers to support the British cause, arguing that if Indians expected to have full 
							rights of citizenship in the British Empire, they also needed to shoulder their 
							responsibilities as well.

					<h2>Gandhi and the Salt March</h2>
					<p>
						In 1930, Gandhi returned to active politics to protest Britain&rsquo;s Salt Acts, 
						which not only prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt&mdash;a dietary 
						staple&mdash;but imposed a heavy tax that hit the country&rsquo;s poorest particularly hard. 
						Gandhi planned a new Satyagraha campaign that entailed a 390-kilometer/240-mile march to the 
						Arabian Sea, where he would collect salt in symbolic defiance of the government monopoly.
					</p>
					<p>
						&ldquo;My ambition is no less than to convert the British people through non-violence and 
						thus make them see the wrong they have done to India,&rdquo; he wrote days before the march 
						to the British viceroy, Lord Irwin.</p>
					<p>
						Wearing a homespun white shawl and sandals and carrying a walking stick, Gandhi set out from 
						his religious retreat in Sabarmati on March 12, 1930, with a few dozen followers. By the 
						time he arrived 24 days later in the coastal town of Dandi, the ranks of the marchers swelled, 
						and Gandhi broke the law by making salt from evaporated seawater.</p>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.history.com/topics/salt-march" target="_blank">The Salt March</a>&nbsp;sparked 
						similar protests, and mass civil disobedience swept across India. Approximately 60,000 Indians were
						jailed for breaking the Salt Acts, including Gandhi, who was imprisoned in May 1930. Still, 
						the protests against the Salt Acts elevated Gandhi into a transcendent figure around the world, 
						and he was named Time magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man of the Year&rdquo; for 1930.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gandhi was released from prison in January 1931, and two months later he made an agreement 
						with Lord Irwin to end the Salt Satyagraha in exchange for concessions that included the release 
						of thousands of political prisoners. The agreement, however, largely kept the Salt Acts intact, 
						but it did give those who lived on the coasts the right to harvest salt from the sea. 
						Hoping that the agreement would be a stepping-stone to home rule, Gandhi attended the London 
						Round Table Conference on Indian constitutional reform in August 1931 as the sole representative 
						of the Indian National Congress. The conference, however, proved fruitless.

				<h2>Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
				<p>
					The inspiring life of Mahatma Gandhi came to an end on 30th&nbsp;January 1948, 
					when he was shot by a fanatic, Nathuram Godse, at point-blank range. Nathuram was a 
					Hindu radical, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by ensuring the partition 
					payment to Pakistan. Godse and his co-conspirator, Narayan Apte, were later tried and convicted. 
					They were executed on 15th November 1949.&nbsp;

					<h2>Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s Legacy</h2>
					<p>
						Mahatma Gandhi proposed the acceptance and practice of truth, non-violence, vegetarianism, 
						Brahmacharya (celibacy), simplicity and faith in God. Though he would be remembered forever as 
						the man who fought for Indian independence, his greatest legacies are the tools he used in his 
						fight against the British. These methods inspired several other world leaders in their struggle 
						against injustice. His statues are installed all over the world and he is considered the most 
						prominent personality in Indian history.

					<h2>Literary Works</h2>
					<p>
						Gandhi was a prolific writer. One of Gandhi's earliest publications,&nbsp;<em>Hind Swaraj</em>, 
						published in Gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual blueprint" for India's independence
						movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read 
						"No Rights Reserved".For decades he edited several newspapers including&nbsp;
						<em><a title="Harijan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harijan">Harijan</a></em>
						&nbsp;in Gujarati, in&nbsp;<a title="Hindi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">
						Hindi</a>&nbsp;and in the English language;&nbsp;<em><a title="Indian Opinion" 
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Opinion">Indian Opinion</a></em>&nbsp;
						while in South Africa and,&nbsp;<em><a title="Young India" 
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_India">Young India</a></em>, in English, 
						and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his return to India. Later, Navajivan was also 
						published in Hindi. In addition, he wrote letters almost every day to individuals and 
						newspapers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Gandhi also wrote several books including his autobiography,&nbsp;<em>
						<a title="The Story of My Experiments with Truth" 
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_My_Experiments_with_Truth">
						The Story of My Experiments with Truth</a>&nbsp;(Gujarātī "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા")</em>, 
						of which he bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.
						&nbsp;His other autobiographies included:&nbsp;
						<em>Satyagraha in South Africa</em>&nbsp;about his struggle there,&nbsp;<em>
						<a title="Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule" 
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hind_Swaraj_or_Indian_Home_Rule">
						Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule</a></em>, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in 
						Gujarati of&nbsp;<a title="John Ruskin" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ruskin">
						John Ruskin</a>'s&nbsp;<em><a title="Unto This Last" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unto_This_Last">
						Unto This Last</a></em>.<sup id="cite_ref-Unto_this_last_361-0" class="reference">
						</sup>&nbsp;This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books.<sup id="cite_ref-Pareku_362-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#cite_note-Pareku-362">[362]</a></sup></p>
					<p>
						Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name&nbsp;<em>
						<a class="extiw" title="s:The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi" 
						href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Collected_Works_of_Mahatma_Gandhi">
						The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi</a></em>&nbsp;in the 1960s. 
						The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about a hundred volumes. 
						In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a controversy, 
						as it contained a large number of errors and omissions.
						&nbsp;The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.

					<h2>Religion and Beliefs</h2>
					<p>
						Gandhi grew up worshiping the Hindu god Vishnu and following Jainism, a morally rigorous 
						ancient Indian religion that espoused non-violence, fasting, meditation and vegetarianism.
					</p>
					<p>
						During Gandhi&rsquo;s first stay in London, from 1888 to 1891, he became more committed to 
						a meatless diet, joining the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society, and started 
						to read a variety of sacred texts to learn more about world religions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Living in South Africa, Gandhi continued to study world religions. &ldquo;The religious 
						spirit within me became a living force,&rdquo; he wrote of his time there. He immersed 
						in sacred Hindu spiritual texts and adopted a life of simplicity, austerity, fasting and 
						celibacy that was free of material goods.
